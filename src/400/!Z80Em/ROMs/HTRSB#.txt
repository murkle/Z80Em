Hi folks,

great to see that there are still specky fans out there.

When i had a spectrum i wrote an enhanced operating system for the spectrum
hardware.

This "new" rom is compatible to the old one but has the following
enhancements:

1) the hardware-reset generates "L-BREAK into program" message even when
executing
    machine code. For original reset press the space-key while resetting.
2) the hardware-nmi saves screen$ on tape or prints it depending on the
following keypress

3) The current basic line got a flashing ">"-sign.
4) You can use the cursor-up-and-down keys when editing a basic line
5) when selecting a basic line in the listing with cursor-up-down the
cursor-right key starts
   the edit task.

The following new tokens or commands have been implemented
ss=Symbol Shift

ss-1:	EDIT [linenumber]		edit a special line
ss-2:	L-Cursor			Tokens can be typed letterwise. Perfect for emulators!!!
ss-3:	DELETE [startline][,endline]	delete basiclines
ss-4:	DELREM [startline][,endline]	delete REM-lines
ss-5:	MEMORY			displays free memory below RAMTOP
ss-6:	FIND linenumber		displays memory-adress of basic line
ss-7:	ERASE "m";1;                           Automatic Input
ss-9:	CAT 1 <ENTER>		Automatic Input
ss-0:	FORMAT "m";1;"L-Cursor" 	Automatic Input
ss-j:	LOAD *"m";1;"L-Cursor"		Automatic Input
ss-s:	SAVE *"m";1;			Automatic Input
ss-t:	MERGE *"m";1;"L-Cursor"	Automatic Input
ss-r:	VERIFY *"m";1;			Automatic Input
ss-m:	LOAD *"m";1;"run" <ENTER> 	Automatic Input
