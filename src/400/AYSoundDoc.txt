AYSound_Init
	R0 = 0 for voices, <>0 for use with Z80Support's sound code
	Initialises AYSound for use.
	Only call with R0<>0 if Z80_SoundInit has just been called.

AYSound_Stop
	Shuts down AYSound and restores the previous sound configuration.
	If using Z80Support, this must be called before Z80_SoundKill, and
	you must SOUND x,0,0,0 on all channels.

AYSound_Read
	Reads the AY registers into the 16-byte block pointed to by R0.

AYSound_Write
	R0 = register, R1 = contents, R2 = clock cycles to next	interrupt
	- writes to the given register, taking effect at the specified time
	*OR*
	R0 -> register block
	- writes to all the AY registers. R2 is assumed to be 0 for timing
	purposes.

AYSound_FastRW
	Returns R0 = read, R1 = write USR, R2 = write SVC
	Call these addresses directly as for the above read/write SWIs.

AYSound_Volume
	R0 = 0..127, or -1
	Sets the volume level to R0 (if 0..127).
	Returns the previous setting in R0.

AYSound_Speed
	R0 = value based on clock speed, or 0 to read
	R1 = Z80 clock cycles per 1/50s, or 0 to read
	This sets the AY emulation and playback speeds. R0 is a magic number
	which is related to 1.7734MHz and the sample rate; R1 is the value
	used by the emulator back end for speed control purposes.
	The previous settings are always returned.

AYSound_Register
	Registers a user of AYSound. (Actually increments a usage count.)

AYSound_Deregister
	Deregisters a user of AYSound. (Actually decrements a usage count.)

AYSound_Stereo
	R0 = &xy, or -ve
	If +ve, sets the stereo spacing according to x (0..3 corresponding
	to wide, narrow, medium, wide) and the positions:
		0	all centre
		1	ACB (eg. A to left, C at centre, B to right)
		2	ABC
		3	BAC
		4	BCA
		5	CAB
		6	CBA
	The previous setting is returned in R0.

AYSound_Log
	R0 = -1		Read file handle of log file
	R0 = 0		Close log file, if open
	R0 -> filename	Open and initialise the named log file

AYSound_Ticker
	Must be called on every Spectrum interrupt. This ensures that the
	sound data buffer is properly filled, and performs logging
	operations.

AYSound_Emulation
	R0 = -1..1
	If 0 or 1, then sets the emulation mode to "full" (0) or "fast" (1).
	The previous setting is returned in R0.
	The AY's pseudo-sample mode (and the clicking of disabled channels
	when their volume levels are changed) is only emulated in "full"
	mode; there will be /some/ sample degradation. The interaction of
	tone and noise when both are enabled for the same channel is not
	emulated.
	AYSound defaults to "full" mode on machines with at least ARM3.

	Note that sample degradation can be reduced by increasing the
	sampling frequency; this should be done by multiplying the size of
	the DMA buffer by x, and dividing the sampling period by the same x.
	(The ideal sampling frequency is 110837.5Hz (AY clock/16), but this
	is obviously a little impractical.)

	There is currently no support for this, since Z80Support and the
	emulator back end would also need to know about this.

AYSound_Load
	R0 -> filename
	Loads the named AY log file. On Risc PCs, this is loaded into a
	dynamic area; on older Arcs, it's loaded into the RMA.
	(Calls AYSound_Init with R0=0.)

AYSound_Play
	R0 = 0		Stop playing and reset position to start
	R0 = 1		Start playing from current position
	R0 = 2		Pause playback, preserving current position
	R0 = 3		Stop playing and remove tune from memory
	R0 = -1		Read current status (returns R0 = 0..3)
	(Z80Em should check that the status is not 1.)

AYSound_Repeat
	R0 = -1..1
	If 0 or 1, then the repeat status is set to off or on, respectively.
	The previous setting is returned in R0.

AYSound_Pollword
	This is reserved for use by AYPlay. (AYSound sets the pollword to
	certain operation-dependent values upon their completion.)
